# LeetCodeSolutions

This is a generic repository where I plan to post my leet code solutions which I was able to crack. Although they might not be optimal one along the way, but yeah they can help anyone understanding the edge cases in the problem at initial phase. Do hit the star ⭐ if you find it useful anyhow.
